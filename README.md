# Insurance Assistant Chatbot

## Overview
The Insurance Assistant Chatbot is designed to assist insurance agents in efficiently resolving customer queries related to insurance policies. This AI-driven tool leverages advanced embedding and language models available on Databricks to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on both structured customer data and unstructured policy information.

## Features
- **Customer Query Handling**: Agents can ask questions about customer insurance policies, and the assistant will provide answers based on the provided context.
- **Image Analysis**: Users can upload images of accident-damaged vehicles along with descriptions. The assistant will analyze the claims against the images to verify their accuracy.If matching gives a link to file the claim and once the form filled a confirmation mail will be send to user's mail id.
- **Structured and Unstructured Data Utilization**: The assistant can effectively use structured data from customer databases and unstructured data from policy documents.
- **KYC Submission**: Customers can complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements through the assistant. The assistant collects and verifies the necessary documents, streamlining the KYC process for quick policy activation.

## Technologies Used
- **Embedding Model**: `system.ai.bge_large_en_v1_5` for creating embeddings from unstructured policy information.
- **Language Model**: `mistralsystem.ai.mistral_7b_instruct_v0_2` for generating responses to customer queries based on the context provided.
- **Image Analysis**: The image analysis is done with the help of `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **KYC**: PaddleOCR is used to extract and verify text from uploaded KYC documents, ensuring efficient and accurate document processing.
- **Databricks**: The application runs on Databricks, utilizing its powerful data processing capabilities.

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Policy documents (unstructured data) and customer data (structured data) are ingested into the system.
   - The unstructured policy details are transformed into embeddings using the embedding model and stored in a Delta table for efficient retrieval.
   - The structured customer data is stored in designated tables for easy access and management.

2. **Query Processing**: 
   - When an agent poses a question, the assistant retrieves relevant information from both structured and unstructured sources. 
   - It leverages the embeddings stored in the Delta table to enhance the accuracy of responses.

3. **Image Upload and Analysis**:
   - Users can upload images of vehicles involved in accidents.
   - They provide a description of the damage.
   - The assistant checks the user's claims against the uploaded images to validate their accuracy.

4. **KYC Submission**:

- Customers can submit KYC documents through the assistant.
- The assistant uses PaddleOCR to extract and verify information from these documents, enabling a streamlined and efficient process for policy activations. 

## Folder Structure

**Input Folder**: Place example input images in the data/input folder. This folder contains all the images used for image analysis and KYC verification.
**Output Folder**: Processed results and recognized texts will be saved in data/output. This folder will be created automatically if it doesnâ€™t exist.
